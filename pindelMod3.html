  <h3> Story - Cub Scout Blue and Gold Dinner 2023 Surprise </h3>
  <p> On 3/21 we held our 2023 Cub Scout Blue and Gold Dinner. The Blue and Gold Dinner is a special yearly event celebrating <span id = "Story 1"> ____ </span>  It is a time to remember all of the fun activities the Pack participated in during the previous year. </p>
  <p> For this year's celebration we decided to do dinner, while the scouts told jokes and entertained everyone with skits.  The dinner cuisine chosen was <span id = "Story 2"> ____ </span> as it is easy and something we have enjoyed in the past. </p>
  <p> The fourth grade Webelos, of which my son is a member, told silly dad jokes while the Lions (the youngest rank) performed a song with actions called <span id = "Story 3"> ____ </span> that we previously learned at Camp Long Lake. </p>
  <p> After dinner during the awards ceremony, a unique award was presented to an adult leader for them having helped out for several years with the Pack.  Surprisingly, that adult was <span id = "Story 4"> ____ </span> I love helping out so my son and the other scouts have a great time.  I hope they help out others in the future too. </p>
